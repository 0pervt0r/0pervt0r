<p class="first">Pandemonium was originally discovered submerged near a thermal vent within the Let-Vand zone during initial excavation of the Hadal Blacksite. According to molecular data received from compositional analysis, Z-367's body is structurally similar to decomposing organic tissue and synthetic polymers, chemically alike to plastic with trace elements of various manmade metals. All attempts to classify the cellular anatomy of Z-367's flesh have ended in negative results, as Z-367 shows no observable signs of life. Its body remains in a perpetual state of decomposition by some unknown mechanism, noted through the consistent presence of mold and other erosive agents discovered in biological analysis. The Bioparanormal Division has postulated that it collects fresh mass from external sources through consumption, thus remaining intact. Anomalously, it possesses an indeterminate number of intraoral eyes, which appear to function as though alive-though the explanation behind these ocular organs remains unknown, as the Hazard And Ethics Division has deemed further study too dangerous at this time. </p>

<p class="second">Z-367 is capable of rudimentary movement by unknown means, observed to "float" middair at a maximum of approximately 1 meter above solid surfaces. Top speed is somewhat consistent to that of a mid sized marine predator. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p class="third">The internal eyes are deceptively powerful, able to spot movement and subtle shifts in light up to inordinately long distances. If spotted subjects manage to evade Z-367, it will immediately begin hunting in the surrounding area. Spotted targets, inanimate or organic, are observed to be found in all instances. It is unknown what method Z-367 uses for sensory perception, whether it be hearing, scent, or heat, but it seems somewhat capable of primitive reasoning. When living targets are found, Z-367 will attempt to trap them inside an orifice that resembles a toothed mouth, in which subjects are suffocated and dissolved by unknown chemical agents secreted within. If subjects place barriers between themselves and Z-367, the creature will begin to ram its full body into obstruction, its estimated weight and velocity capable of destroying most unsecured structures. This only subsides after an indefinite amount of time if attempts repeatedly fail. </p>

<p> </p>
<p class="fourth">Though research finds no correlation between the two anomalies, Z-367 shares a similar EMP field generated by Z-283. However, the former's electric charge is recorded as being significantly less powerful, causing devices linked to internal power grids to temporarily malfunction when Z-367 is near- though permanent electrical damages are never suffered by the site infrastructure. Theories regarding the origin of this function are scant, as no other biological processes indicate that Z-367 should be capable of producing electric fields. The relation between these two subjects has been largely undetermined, however Grade █ Bioparanormal Researcher Dr. ██████ and his juniors continue to lobby for further research to be conducted. The Hazard and Ethics Division continues to deny all appeals for continued study. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p class="fifth">In the event that Z-367 breaches containment, the pulse it emits will cause unsecured blacksite lights to flicker when it is near. Remaining out of Z-367's line of sight is of utmost importance, however all attempts to evade it once spotted are futile if cover is not available. Z-367 is capable of destroying most doors within the blacksite, thus Personnel are heavily advised to redirect themselves to the nearest facility bunker or similarly armored room as soon as possible. Locker installations in Blacksite Wing █ are designed to be bulletproof, however confirmational testing with Z-367 has been temporarily postponed- resort to this if no other option presents itself. In the event that you are spotted, please prostrate yourself in a secure location and wait for the cleanup detail to retrieve your corpse. </p>
