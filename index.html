<p class="first"><img src="images/htmlbeer1.jpg" width="120" height="180" align="middle" /> Pandemonium was originally discovered submerged near a thermal vent within the Let-Vand zone during initial excavation of the Hadal Blacksite. According to molecular data received from compositional analysis, Z-367's body is structurally similar to decomposing organic tissue and synthetic polymers, chemically alike to plastic with trace elements of various manmade metals. All attempts to classify the cellular anatomy of Z-367's flesh have ended in negative results, as Z-367 shows no observable signs of life. Its body remains in a perpetual state of decomposition by some unknown mechanism, noted through the consistent presence of mold and other erosive agents discovered in biological analysis. The Bioparanormal Division has postulated that it collects fresh mass from external sources through consumption, thus remaining intact. Anomalously, it possesses an indeterminate number of intraoral eyes, which appear to function as though alive-though the explanation behind these ocular organs remains unknown, as the Hazard And Ethics Division has deemed further study too dangerous at this time. </p>
